# programming notes
*Some notes about programming languages that could be useful.*

This is a trash bin where I collects some notes about several programming languages which 
might be useless... or it may turns out to be useful?

The purpose of this repository is such that I could share and search notes conveniently.

**Note**:
- Code here might be wrong, it might not compile at all.
